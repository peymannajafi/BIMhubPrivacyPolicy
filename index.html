# Privacy Policy for BIM hub

**Last updated:** July 1, 2024

This Privacy Policy describes how the BIM hub mobile application ("App") handles information.

**1. Data Collection and Storage**

The BIM hub App is designed to operate locally on your device. All building data, including but not limited to building names, addresses, geolocation, construction details, and related information, is stored directly on your device's local storage (IndexedDB).

* **No Personal Data Collection by Us:** We do not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal data from you through the App. All data you enter or generate within the App remains exclusively on your device.
* **No Data Transmitted to External Servers:** The App does not connect to any external servers or cloud services to store or transmit your data.

**2. Permissions Used**

The App requires the following permissions to function correctly:

* **Camera Access:** Used solely for scanning QR codes to retrieve building information. The App does not record videos or take photos without your explicit action, nor does it transmit camera data.
* **Location Access (Optional):** If you choose to use the "Get Current Location" feature when creating or editing a building profile, the App will access your device's geolocation to populate the coordinates field. This location data is then stored locally on your device and is not transmitted externally. You can choose not to use this feature.

**3. Data Security**

Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on the security of your device. We recommend you secure your device with a strong password or biometric authentication and regularly back up your data. We are not responsible for any unauthorized access to data stored on your device.

**4. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our website (if applicable). You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
